I'm back. I'm challenging myself to post often; to find a rhythm, establish a workflow. 

A while back I was following along with Sarah J Bray and her Hot Dates with your website curriculum. One of her characters was "Mo" - Momentum. It's time for me to get reaquainted with Mo. Inertia is deadly. If I'm already in motion, I don't need to waste energy on getting moving -- I can focus on direction and style and any number of other things. 

So. Here we go.
